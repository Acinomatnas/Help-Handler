'''


Requirements
------------
##### Java version
- 7 and above



Usage
------
The only function needed for basic functionality is ```HelpHandler::handle(int argc, char** argv, const char* help_dialogue)```. Beyond that, most users will only be concerned with ```help_handler_config(bool extra_strings, bool no_arg_help, bool unknown_arg_help)``` to enable/disable matching of arguments which might conflict with your program (h, -h, --h, v, -v, --v) and whether to output help dialogue when no arguments are given. As a bonus, functions support type overloading where applicable if your compiler standard is set to C11 or above. You can refer to the _examples_ folder for more advanced usage.

Basic usage example:
[source,C]
----------
help_handler(argc, argv, "Usage: Test\n");
----------
A negative value is returned if an error occurred, otherwise the number of arguments matched will be returned, (0 if none). It will increase your executable size by ~15KB with no optimizations enabled.
