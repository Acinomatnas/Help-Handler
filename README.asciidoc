Description
-----------
A simple one-header file that does exactly as the name suggests: handles help argument reading and output, which would otherwise be inadequately done boilerplate code - there are various popular projects where simply trying to get usage help is a roll of the dice as to what argument works (nano doesn't support "help", openssl and gcc _only_ support "help" and "--help" respectively, etc), which is not user friendly. Newer programs are better in this regard, but why reinvent the wheel? It's 160 lines of code and two functions!

Requirements
------------
##### Operating System
- Windows
- macOS [small]#(Tested ^Yosemite^)#
- Linux [small]#(Tested ^Fedora-31^)#
- BSD

##### Compiler
- C99 / C++11


Example
-------
The first example call includes a version string, and passes 1 to match for extra arguments (you may also use the pre-defined HELP_MATCH_EXTRA_STRINGS macro). The second function example passes no version string, and disables matching of extra arguments (h, -h, --h, v, -v, --v). The EXIT_FAILURE standard macro is returned if no string was matched:

[source,C]
-----------------
help_handler(argc, argv, "Usage: Test\n", "A version string", 1);
help_handler(argc, argv, "Usage: Test\n", NULL, 0);
