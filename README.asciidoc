Description
-----------
A simple one-header file that does exactly as the name suggests: handles help argument reading and output, which would otherwise be inadequately done boilerplate code - there are various popular projects where simply trying to get usage help is a roll of the dice as to what argument works (nano doesn't support "help", openssl and gcc _only_ support "help" and "--help" respectively, Python only supports "--version", etc.), and are usually not case insensitive which is not user friendly. Newer programs are better in this regard, but why reinvent the wheel? It's two functions!

Requirements
------------
##### Operating System
- Windows
- macOS [small]#(Tested ^Yosemite^)#
- Linux [small]#(Tested ^Fedora-31^)#
- BSD

##### Compiler
- Python - 2.xx through 3.xx
- CPP - C++11
- C - C99


Example
-------
The first example call includes a version string, and passes 1 to match for extra arguments (you may also use the pre-defined HELP_MATCH_EXTRA_STRINGS macro). The second function example passes no version string, and disables matching of extra arguments (h, -h, --h, v, -v, --v). The EXIT_FAILURE standard macro is returned if no string was matched:

##### C
[source,C]
-----------------
help_handler(argc, argv, "Usage: Test\n", "A version string", 1);
help_handler(argc, argv, "Usage: Test\n", NULL, 0);
-----------------
##### C++ (Arguments are optional)
[source,CPP]
-----------------
helpHandler(argc, argv, "Usage: Test\n", "A version string", true);
helpHandler(argc, argv, "Usage: Test\n");
-----------------
##### Python
[source,Python]
-----------------
help_handler("Usage: Test");
